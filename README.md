# German-Credit-Risk

This dataset is taken from Kaggle. The Business problem that we're dealing with here is credit default. In terms of Machine Learning, this is a classification problem. 
Our Goal is to build a model that predicts if giving a credit is a good or bad risk based on the given set of features in the dataset.

Our metric for this business problems would be F1 -score a combined measure of recall and precison..


From the German_Credit_Risk_EDA notebook, it is evident that the dataset has an imbalanced target values. So, we might have to go for undersampling or oversampling of Data for training the model.

I'll upload the Modeling code soon...
